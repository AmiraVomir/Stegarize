## Description ##
  > This web app aims at secure-conscious users who want to conceal their messages and communcations.

## Preview
> A deployed version of the project can be found [here](https://stegarize.herokuapp.com/).

## Summary ##
  > Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection. The use of steganography can be combined with encryption as an extra step for hiding or protecting data. This app allows user to upload an image, encode the image with text and reveal the hidden text on subsequent re-upload.

## Problem ##
  > One of the most important factors in the internet age is the security of information. Furthermore, it is sometimes not enough to keep information secret, but the existence of information as well.

## Solution ##
  > Unlike cryptography, which conceals the contents of a secret message, steganography conceals the very fact that there is a message or any communication at all. This web app solves the problem of hiding your communiciton itself.

## Using the Product ##
  > To encode an image with information, upload an image, type in the information and click "Encode".
  
  > To decode an image, upload an image and click "Decode".
